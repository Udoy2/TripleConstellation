            We're a 2 man team. Both of us are College students, as well as self taught in the aspects of Game Development and still learning everything to add to that statement. We're doing this project out of love for video games, that we grew up playing. Stories that got etched in our Hearts, Left an Impact that words are not capable enough of describing. Hence, us trying to give this a spin of our own. It would really make all the effort and time that we put into this project that much worth while, If you guys come to like our project and share your thoughts and opinions on our project so that we can further improve it to the best of our ability.
